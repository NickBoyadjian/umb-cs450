The system wouldn't be sound if there was an overflow error because
there could be a scenario where the memory counter gets set back 
to zero which could result in a function being executed using the wrong
reference to a variable. (in the case where one reuses a variable name
inside a function or with a parameter name, and said name exists in the curren
false reference with a different value).
